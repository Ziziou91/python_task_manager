## Intent

Purpose of this project is to practice working with and refactoring code. All code in task_manager.py as of initial commit was already provided. I haved extended the functionality of this system, and refactored where appropiate, to improve readability and adopt best practices. TDD approach has been adopted to ensure code quality and behaviour.

Admin and employee user stories written to determine functionality.

As a user you should be able to:
